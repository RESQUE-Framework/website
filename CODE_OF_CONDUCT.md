# Code of conduct: Creating a friendly and intellectually stimulating space
*Version 1.0, 2023-08-04*
(This CoC is based on the [CoC of the German Reproducibility Network](https://reproducibilitynetwork.de/coc/), Version 1.0, from 2022-11-09)

Epistemic responsibility[^1] – which is based on virtues such as open-mindedness, diligence, and honesty – and interpersonal respect are central values of this project. Therefore we aim to create an open, friendly, diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community and scholarly context in which insights and criticisms are welcome from all participants, regardless of personal characteristics or academic rank.

### Our values and what follows from them:

- Epistemic responsibility and trustworthiness are core values for us as scientists. Critical discussion and evaluation of research has a vital function for the self-correction and progress of science, and we gracefully accept constructive criticism. When criticizing others’ research, we differentiate between the research (as output) and the researcher as a person. We acknowledge that such a separation is sometimes difficult. We are aware of the impact that criticism can have on the lives and careers of researchers, in particular early career researchers, and always aim to balance the values of intellectual honesty and kindness towards our colleagues.
- We are convinced that a diversity of personal backgrounds and viewpoints is key to scientific progress. We embrace this diversity and believe in the power of collaboration and co-creation. We include as many people as possible in group interactions by being respectful and inviting.
- We discuss views and claims based on the evidence and the quality of arguments, not based on the status of the people making the claim, nor their personal characteristics or their academic rank.
- Scientific debates can feel challenging or even uncomfortable. But also in heated debates we show respect and civility to our fellow colleagues, without discrimination or personal attacks.
- We respect the private sphere of other people. We never share others’ private information without their consent.

### We do not tolerate…

… any form of public or private harassment, either in person, on event platforms or social media. This includes abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning language and behaviour. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue or talks. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the project.

### Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement

If you think that a project member acts against these guidelines, please report this to one of the project maintainers. The complaint will be investigated based on the principles of impartiality, proportionality, and due process ensuring the anonymity of both reporter and reportee. We ask all involved parties to await the outcome of such investigations before they publicly comment or act on potentially unfounded allegations. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.

[^1]: Epistemic Responsibility is about the goal to “produce, maintain, and disseminate knowledge and other knowledge-related (or: epistemic) goods, such as insight, rational belief, and understanding” (Lechner et al, 2022) and has been defined as "related to the capacity to engage in adequate policies in the search of truth, the ability to give reasons, or the readiness to revise one's beliefs in the light of new evidence.” (Echeverri, 2011).
