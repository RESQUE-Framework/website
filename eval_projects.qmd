Several research projects work(ed) on the evaluation of the RESQUE rating scheme:

- Etzel, F. T. (2023, September 4). One Step Closer Towards Responsible Research Assessment in Psychology: Evaluation and Testing of a New Tool in Practice. [https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/3uf7w](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/3uf7w)

::: {.callout-note title="Key findings"}
 63 papers nominated by 21 participating researchers were rated by external raters (not the authors thmeselves) according to the *RESQUE-Pubs* scheme. Inter-rater reliability, associations between the new and traditional indicators, and feedback from the participants on the new tool were examined. Inter-rater reliability for the three raters varied between the different items of the scheme. Besides a negative association between the new indicators and the uncorrected h-index, no other significant associations were found. The feedback from participants revealed the importance of transparency concerning the scheme.
