## Choose your indicators
The RESQUE framework decisively promotes a "buffett table approach": From the list of available indicators, hiring committees choose those which show a fit to the position and to the preferences and the research culture of the institution.

We provide a lean **core set** with the basic quality indicators that fit to the vast majority of research in any psycghological sub-discipline. This core set is recommended for all hiring committees (although any indicator can be deselected).

This can be expanded by multiple **expansion packs** that contain additional indicators. These packs are tailored to specific research areas or research cultures.

Currently, the selection of indicators itself (if you do not want to use the default core set) is done by adjusting the `json` files in the subfolder `/packs` of the [collector app](https://github.com/RESQUE-Framework/collector-app). In these config files, all indicators can be adjusted, removed, or new indicators added. We suggest that you fork our repository and make your changes in your personal copy. Currently, adapting the questions of the collector app requires some technical knowledge. However, we are happy to [assist](team.qmd) in customizing the app for your hiring committee.


## Choose your weights

We make suggestions for weights that define how much each indicator contributes to the rigor score(s). But every committee can define their own weights.

If an indicator gets the weight 0 (but is not removed from the collector app), it becomes a **descriptive** indicator. It does not contribute to any quality score, but the committee still can see the answers.
