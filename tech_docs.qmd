## Postprocessing the applicants' data

The applicants' data (acquired by the Collector app) is stored in `json` files that can be imported in R with the [RESQUER package](https://github.com/RESQUE-Framework/RESQUER). The package preprocesses the data and enriches it with:

- citation metrics from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org)
- impact metrics from [BIP!](https://bip.imsi.athenarc.gr)
- the [TOP factor](https://www.topfactor.org) for the journals the author is publishing in

Furthermore, the package provides an interactive dashboard that allows to compare multiple candidates.
