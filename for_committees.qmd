## Choose your indicators
The RESQUE framework decisively promotes a "buffett table approach": From the list of available indicators, hiring committees choose those which show a fit to the position and to the preferences and the research culture of the institution.

The RESQUE App already has basic customization features. With the simple [Form Builder](https://resque-framework.github.io/website/web/builder) website, committees can choose:

- The maximum number of submittable research outputs (default: 10)
- The number of top papers ('best research outputs') that can be selected (default: 3)
- The threshold for 'number of required research outputs' warning (default: 5): The app computes an average rigor score, but that needs at least some scoreable research outputs.

Currently, the selection of indicators itself (if you do not want to use the default core set) is done by adjusting the `json` files in the subfolder `/packs` of the [collector app](https://github.com/RESQUE-Framework/collector-app). In these config files, all indicators can be adjusted, removed, or new indicators added.

We suggest that you fork our repository and make your changes in your personal copy. Adapting the questions of the collector app requires some technical knowledge. However, we are happy to [assist](team.qmd) in customizing the app for your hiring committee.


## Choose your weights

We make suggestions for weights that define how much each indicator contributes to the rigor score(s). But every committee can define their own weights.

If an indicator gets the weight 0 (but is not removed from the collector app), it becomes a **descriptive** indicator. It does not contribute to any quality score, but the committee still can see the answers.
