title: "Customizing RESQUE"

RESQUE advocates a "buffet table approach", where each committee can select and adjust the indicators that are relevant for them.
Currently, however, this customization of the [Collector App](https://resque-framework.github.io/collector-app) needs some technical expertise.

The selection of indicators itself (if you do not want to use the default core set) is done by adjusting the `json` files in the subfolder `/packs` of the [Collector App](https://github.com/RESQUE-Framework/collector-app). In these config files, all indicators can be adjusted, removed, or new indicators added. 

We suggest that you fork our repository and make your changes in your personal copy. If you activate Github Pages, you will get a dedicated URL for the Collector App of your hiring committee (this could be, for example, `https://resque-framework.github.io/collector-app-eichstaett`). **This [manual](https://github.com/RESQUE-Framework/collector-app/blob/main/How_to_fork.md) explains how to create a fork step by step.**

We are happy to [assist](team.qmd) in customizing the app for your hiring committee.
