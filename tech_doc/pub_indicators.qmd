Notes: 

- You can browse all available indicators (also archived versions) on [this website](https://resque-framework.github.io/collector-app/preview).
- Although you can click the checkboxes on this preview, this does not have any effect. The checkboxes are only for visualization purposes. The actual app can be found [here](https://resque-framework.github.io/collector-app/).
- In the Collector App, many indicators are shown conditionally, depending on answers to previous items. Hence, the actual number of indicators presented to applicants typically is lower.
