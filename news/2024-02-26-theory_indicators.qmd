A working group consisting of Nele Freyer, Jens Lange, Daniel Leising, Philipp Musfeld, and Felix Schönbrodt developed a set of indicators that allows to evaluate theory-guided research.

The indicators cover both narrative and formal theories, and they cover both theory development and theory testing.

In the general philosophy of RESQUE, these indicators mostly focus on "hygiene factors": Properties of theory-guided research that are necessary but not sufficient for high-quality research.

You can see the current version of the theory indicators here: [Expansion pack: Theory-guided research and theory development](../tech_doc/EP-theorizing.qmd)
