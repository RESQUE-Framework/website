::: {.callout-warning}
Both the app for entering the data and the profile are in beta stage and not finalized yet.
Things might change substantially in the near future. If you want to use the RESQUE framework in practice please [contact](/team.qmd) us.
:::

You can enter the data for up to 10 research contributions (publications, data set, or research software) in the [RESQUE Collector](https://nicebread.github.io/RESQUE/web/) app.

<!-- 
1. When done, save the data as a local `json` file.
2. Go to the [RESQUE Profiler](http://shiny.psy.lmu.de/felix/RESQUE_profile/) app, upload your `json` file, and get your Research Profile.
 -->

The visualization of the results will be made available as an app in spring 2024; here's a preview of some possible visualizations:
